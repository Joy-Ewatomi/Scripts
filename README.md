## 📖 About

Collection of Python automation scripts built to streamline OSINT investigations and digital forensics workflows.

**Philosophy:** Good investigators don't just use tools - they build them. These scripts transform time-consuming manual tasks into automated, repeatable processes.

**Built by:** Joy Ewatomi | [ShadowNode Intelligence Agency](https://github.com/Joy-Ewatomi/JoyEwatomi)  
**Purpose:** Practical automation for real-world investigations


## 🛠️ Tools

### 1. Domain Intelligence Analyzer
**Purpose:** Automated WHOIS lookup and domain profiling

**Features:**
- Owner/organization identification
- Registrar verification  
- Domain age calculation
- Expiration date tracking
- Clean, investigator-friendly output

**Use Cases:**
- Phishing investigation (identifying suspicious domain patterns)
- Threat intelligence (tracking attacker infrastructure)
- Brand protection (monitoring similar domains)
- Due diligence (verifying business legitimacy)

**Tech Stack:** `python-whois`, `datetime`

💡 Philosophy
## Why build from scratch?
Understanding - Building tools teaches you how they work
Customization - Tailor solutions to specific investigation needs
Independence - Never rely on tools that might disappear or become paid
Scale - Automation turns 4-hour tasks into 15-minute tasks
Learning approach: Each tool solves a real problem I encountered during investigations. No theoretical exercises - only practical solutions.
